# 25. Creating Shapes


- Create a New Composition: Open After Effects and create a new composition by going to "Composition" > "New Composition." Set the desired dimensions, duration, and frame rate for your animation.

- Create a Shape Layer: Right-click on the composition panel and select "New" > "Shape Layer" to create a new shape layer. Alternatively, you can click on the "Shape Layer" button in the toolbar.

- Draw a Shape: With the shape layer selected, choose a shape tool from the toolbar, such as the Rectangle, Ellipse, or Polygon tool. Click and drag on the composition panel to draw the shape.

- Customize the Shape: With the shape layer selected, you can customize various properties such as stroke color, fill color, stroke width, opacity, and more in the "Contents" section of the shape layer in the timeline panel.

- Animate the Shape: To animate the shape, enable the keyframe animation for the desired properties. Click on the stopwatch icon next to the property you want to animate in the timeline panel to create the first keyframe. Move the playhead to a different time, adjust the property's value, and create another keyframe. After Effects will automatically interpolate the values between keyframes to create smooth animation.

- Add Additional Shapes and Animations: To create complex shape animations, you can add multiple shape layers, animate their properties individually, and use keyframes to control the timing and transitions between different shapes.

- Experiment with Effects and Transformations: After Effects offers a wide range of effects and transformations that you can apply to shape layers. Experiment with effects like gradient fills, shadows, glows, and transformations like scaling, rotation, and position to enhance your shape animations.

- Preview and Render: Use the preview panel to preview your shape animation in real-time. Once you're satisfied, go to "Composition" > "Add to Render Queue" to render your animation into a video file.
