# 26. Fill and Stroke

1. Select the Shape Layer: Make sure you have a shape layer created in your composition, either by creating a new one or by selecting an existing shape layer.

2. Access Shape Layer Properties: In the timeline panel, expand the shape layer to reveal its properties. Look for the "Contents" section, which contains the shape-related properties.

3. Customize Fill Color: To change the fill color of the shape, twirl down the "Contents" section and locate the "Fill" property. Click on the color swatch next to "Fill" to open the color picker. Choose a new color for the fill, or use the eyedropper tool to sample a color from your composition or another layer.

4. Adjust Stroke Settings: If you want to add a stroke (outline) to your shape, twirl down the "Contents" section and find the "Stroke" property. You can enable or disable the stroke by clicking the stopwatch icon next to it. Adjust the stroke color by clicking on the color swatch and selecting a new color.

5. Modify Stroke Width: To control the thickness of the stroke, locate the "Stroke Width" property under the "Stroke" section. Adjust the value to increase or decrease the stroke thickness.
