# 30, Offset Paths

1. Create a Shape Layer: Start by creating a shape layer or selecting an existing shape layer to which you want to apply the offset effect.

2. Apply the Offset Paths Effect: With the shape layer selected, go to the "Add" menu at the top menu bar and choose "Offset Paths." This will apply the Offset Paths effect to the selected shape layer.

3. Adjust the Offset Amount: In the Effect Controls panel, you'll find the Offset Paths properties. The most important property is the "Amount" parameter. Adjust this parameter to control the distance and direction of the offset.

   - Positive Values: A positive value will offset the shape outward from its original position. Increasing the value will create a larger offset.

   - Negative Values: A negative value will offset the shape inward from its original position. Decreasing the value will create a smaller offset.

4. Modify Other Offset Properties (Optional): The Offset Paths effect offers additional properties that you can modify to further customize the offset effect.

   - Join Type: You can choose between "Miter," "Round," or "Bevel" to determine how corners are joined when the shape is offset.

   - Join Limit: This property controls the limit for miter joins. Adjusting this value determines when the join type changes from miter to bevel.
