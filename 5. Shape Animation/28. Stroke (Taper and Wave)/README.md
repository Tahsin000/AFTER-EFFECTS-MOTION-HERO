# 28. Stroke (Taper and Wave)


1. Apply the Stroke Effect: Select the shape layer to which you want to apply the stroke effect. Then go to the "Effects & Presets" panel, search for "Stroke," and apply the "Stroke" effect to the layer.

2. Adjust the Stroke Width and Color: In the Effect Controls panel, you'll find various properties to customize the stroke. Start by adjusting the "Paint Style" to "On Transparent" or "On Original." Then modify the "Brush Size" to set the width of the stroke. Additionally, you can change the stroke color by modifying the "Paint" property.

3. Enable Taper: To create a tapered stroke that gradually narrows or widens along its length, enable the "Taper" option. This option allows you to control the starting and ending widths of the stroke.
    - Start Taper: Set the "Start" parameter to define the width of the stroke at its beginning point. You can use a specific value or adjust the percentage.
    - End Taper: Set the "End" parameter to determine the width of the stroke at its end point. Again, you can use a specific value or adjust the percentage.
    
4. Apply the Wave Effect: The Stroke effect also includes a "Wave" option that creates a wavy or oscillating movement along the stroke.

    - Enable Wave: Check the "Wave" option to activate the wave effect.

    - Adjust Wave Properties: You can customize various properties to control the appearance of the wave effect:

        - Wave Height: Set the amplitude or height of the waves.
        - Wave Width: Adjust the wavelength or width of each wave.
        - Wave Speed: Modify the speed at which the waves move along the stroke.
        - Wave Phase: Change the starting position or phase of the wave effect.
5. Additional Stroke Customizations: You can further customize the stroke effect by adjusting properties like the "Opacity" to control transparency, "Blend Mode" to change the blending with the underlying layers, and "Offset" to shift the stroke position.
