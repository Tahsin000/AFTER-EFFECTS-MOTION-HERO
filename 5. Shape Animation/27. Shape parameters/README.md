# 27. Shape parameters

1. Fill: The fill parameter controls the color or pattern used to fill the shape. You can choose a solid color, gradient, or pattern as the fill.

2. Stroke: The stroke parameter determines the outline or border of the shape. You can adjust the stroke color, width, and style (such as dashed or dotted lines).

3. Transform: The transform parameters include properties like position, scale, and rotation, which allow you to modify the shape's placement, size, and orientation.

4. Opacity: The opacity parameter controls the transparency of the shape. By adjusting the opacity, you can make the shape more or less transparent.

5. Roundness: This parameter is applicable to shapes like rectangles or polygons and allows you to adjust the curvature of the shape's corners.

6. Path: The path parameter defines the shape's geometry. You can manipulate the path by adding or removing anchor points and adjusting their positions to create custom shapes.

7. Grouping and Parenting: After Effects enables you to group shapes together using the Group Shape property. Parenting allows you to create hierarchies where one shape layer controls the transformations of another shape layer.

8. Trim Paths: The trim paths parameter enables you to animate the start and end points of a shape, allowing you to create effects like drawing or revealing the shape over time.

9. Repeater: With the repeater parameter, you can duplicate and repeat a shape, creating patterns or complex designs. You can adjust properties like the number of copies, offset, and transformations applied to each repeated shape.

10. Merge Paths: The merge paths parameter combines multiple shapes into a single shape. It allows you to create intricate shapes by adding, subtracting, or intersecting different shapes.
