1. Create Multiple Shape Layers: Start by creating multiple shape layers or multiple shapes within a single shape layer. These shapes can be any combination of rectangles, ellipses, polygons, or custom paths.

2. Select the Shape Layers: Select all the shape layers or individual shapes within a single shape layer that you want to merge.

3. Apply Merge Paths: With the shape layers selected, go to the "Add" menu at the top menu bar and choose "Merge Paths." This will add the Merge Paths operation to the selected shape layers.

4. Choose the Merge Operation: In the Merge Paths operation options, you'll find three merge operations: Add, Subtract, and Intersect.
    - Add: This operation combines the selected shapes, creating a single shape that encompasses all the areas covered by the original shapes.
    - Subtract: This operation subtracts the overlapping areas of the selected shapes, creating a single shape with the overlapping areas removed.
    - Intersect: This operation keeps only the overlapping areas of the selected shapes, creating a single shape with the common areas preserved.

5. Modify the Merge Paths Order: If you have multiple shapes selected, you can change the order of the shapes in the stack to determine how they merge. The shape at the top of the stack is the shape that affects the final result the most.

6. Refine and Animate: After merging the shapes, you can further refine and animate the resulting shape. You can adjust the fill and stroke properties, apply effects, animate position, scale, rotation, or other parameters to create dynamic shape animations.
